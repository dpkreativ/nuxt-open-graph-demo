        <p>
          Life is a struggle for single father Chris Gardner (Will Smith).
          Evicted from their apartment, he and his young son (Jaden Christopher
          Syre Smith) find themselves alone with no place to go. Even though
          Chris eventually lands a job as an intern at a prestigious brokerage
          firm, the position pays no money. The pair must live in shelters and
          endure many hardships, but Chris refuses to give in to despair as he
          struggles to create a better life for himself and his son.
